# UniSwap

### ✨ Introduction
The current challenge for college students is the lack of a dedicated platform for buying and selling second-hand books and other items. To address this challenge, this application aims to foster student-to-student transactions within the confines of their educational institution. This platform will facilitate easy and secure exchanges, enabling students to buy and sell items relevant to their studies, dorm life, and extracurricular activities within their campus community. By providing a centralized marketplace, our app will streamline the process of finding and acquiring essential items, fostering a sense of community and collaboration among students.
